; Custom instructions to send to the external memory after initialization. Format is instruction code plus data to send in between optional brakets. 
; These instructions will be executed each time the qspi peripheral is initiated by nrfjprog. 
; To improve execution speed on consecutive interations with QSPI, you can run nrfjprog once with custom initialization, and then comment out the lines below.
; Numbers can be given in decimal, hex (starting with either 0x or 0X) and binary (starting with either 0b or 0B) formats. 
; The custom instructions will be executed in the order found. 

; For MX25R1635F on TTGO board, only two data lines are connected
; This example includes two commands, first a WREN (WRite ENable) and then a WRSR (WRite Satus Register) enabling Quad Operation and the High Performance
; mode.  For normal operation you might want low power mode instead.
