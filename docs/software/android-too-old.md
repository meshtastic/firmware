# Your android application needs updating

Hi.

If you've landed here that means your android application is too old for the running device firmware.  Usually our updates are backwards compatible, but about once a year we have a "major protocol update" which requires all apps and devices to update to keep working with that version.  Version 1.2 in March 2021 was one of those updates.

If you have problems/questions please post in our [forum](https://meshtastic.discourse.group) and some nice person will probably help.
