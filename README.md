## Overview

This repository contains the device firmware for the Meshtastic project. Adapted for FrostAway products.

- **[Building Instructions](https://meshtastic.org/docs/development/firmware/build)**
- **[Flashing Instructions](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/)**

## Changes
- This version modifies the behavior on alert_bell messages: uses bell character as 0x24 ($) this means the notification is taken when a message contains the '$' character. Also modifies the behavior because it makes the gpio pin bistable so notifications act like pin toggle when bell char is received.
