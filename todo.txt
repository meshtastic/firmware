A non-exhaustive task list

Features
====================
[]      adhoc ping
[]      canned message
[]      map scale indicator 
[wip]   eink drivers for other devices
[]      mini-compass on nodelist
[]      additional user applets
[]      GPS stats in menu
[]      GPS & Bluetooth toggle in menu
[wip]   add extended ascii / foreign language chars - Fonts for Windows-1250, Windows-1251 (Windows-1252?)

Improvements
====================
[]      Better detection of position changes in PositionsApplet
[]      NodeListApplets should only requestUpdate for changed signal strength if node 0-hops (showing signal bars)
[]      Descriptive headers for some settings in menu
[]      Re-render applets when RTC is set. Some UI elements change (e.g. "Recents" applet counts)
[]      Don't save on shutdown / reboot within N seconds of boot. Protect flash against weird boot loops.
[]      Applet to display critical faults
[]      OEM Bootscreen
[]      Aux button: exit menu without switching tile focus,

Known Bugs
=====================
[]      Timestamps don't update. Needs to happen once a day. "6PM -> Yesterday". Make the WindowManager do it.
[]      Root menu: header breaks spacing if rtc set while menu open
[]      Applets don't re-render when node is removed via admin command
[]      Tile highlight rendered below header for threaded message applets
[]      NodeListApplets: *very* large distances spill over the divider
[]      Menu cursor does not always return to top when exited

Chores
==========
[]      Make runOnce methods private
[]      Helper method in InkHUD::Drivers::EInk to simplify framebuffer arithmetic, for anyone else using NicheGraphics
[]      Remove parentheses from methods mentioned in comments, to make code search easier
[]      Decouple the original Screen class from bluetooth code: observe "BluetoothStatus" instead
[]      Honor userprefs / config gpio overrides
[]      Make rotation default to 0 instead of 1, if not specified
[]      Use class enums?
