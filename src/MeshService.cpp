receivedPacketQueue - this is a queue of messages we've received from the mesh, which we are keeping to deliver to the phone.
It is implemented with a FreeRTos queue (wrapped with a little RTQueue class) of pointers to MeshPacket protobufs (which were
alloced with new). After a packet ptr is removed from the queue and processed it should be deleted.  (eventually we should move
sent packets into a 'sentToPhone' queue of packets we can delete just as soon as we are sure the phone has acked those packets -
when the phone writes to FromNum)

mesh - an instance of Mesh class.  Which manages the interface to the mesh radio library, reception of packets from other nodes,
arbitrating to select a node number and keeping the current nodedb.

*/

/* Broadcast when a newly powered mesh node wants to find a node num it can use

The algoritm is as follows:
* when a node starts up, it broadcasts their user and the normal flow is for all other nodes to reply with their User as well (so
the new node can build its node db)
* If a node ever receives a User (not just the first broadcast) message where the sender node number equals our node number, that
indicates a collision has occurred and the following steps should happen:

If the receiving node (that was already in the mesh)'s macaddr is LOWER than the new User who just tried to sign in: it gets to
keep its nodenum.  We send a broadcast message of OUR User (we use a broadcast so that the other node can receive our message,
considering we have the same id - it also serves to let observers correct their nodedb) - this case is rare so it should be okay.

If any node receives a User where the macaddr is GTE than their local macaddr, they have been vetoed and should pick a new random
nodenum (filtering against whatever it knows about the nodedb) and rebroadcast their User.

FIXME in the initial proof of concept we just skip the entire want/deny flow and just hand pick node numbers at first.
