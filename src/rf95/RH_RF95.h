///
/// \par Overview
///
/// This class provides basic functions for sending and receiving unaddressed,
/// unreliable datagrams of arbitrary length to 251 octets per packet.
///
/// Manager classes may use this class to implement reliable, addressed datagrams and streams,
/// mesh routers, repeaters, translators etc.
///
/// Naturally, for any 2 radios to communicate that must be configured to use the same frequency and
/// modulation scheme.
///
/// This Driver provides an object-oriented interface for sending and receiving data messages with Hope-RF
/// RFM95/96/97/98(W), Semtech SX1276/77/78/79 and compatible radio modules in LoRa mode.
///
/// The Hope-RF (http://www.hoperf.com) RFM95/96/97/98(W) and Semtech SX1276/77/78/79 is a low-cost ISM transceiver
/// chip. It supports FSK, GFSK, OOK over a wide range of frequencies and
/// programmable data rates, and it also supports the proprietary LoRA (Long Range) mode, which
/// is the only mode supported in this RadioHead driver.
///
/// This Driver provides functions for sending and receiving messages of up
/// to 251 octets on any frequency supported by the radio, in a range of
/// predefined Bandwidths, Spreading Factors and Coding Rates.  Frequency can be set with
/// 61Hz precision to any frequency from 240.0MHz to 960.0MHz. Caution: most modules only support a more limited
/// range of frequencies due to antenna tuning.
///
/// Up to 2 modules can be connected to an Arduino (3 on a Mega),
/// permitting the construction of translators and frequency changers, etc.
///
/// Support for other features such as transmitter power control etc is
/// also provided.
///
/// Tested on MinWirelessLoRa with arduino-1.0.5
/// on OpenSuSE 13.1.
/// Also tested with Teensy3.1, Modtronix inAir4 and Arduino 1.6.5 on OpenSuSE 13.1
///
/// \par Packet Format
///
/// All messages sent and received by this RH_RF95 Driver conform to this packet format:
///
/// - LoRa mode:
/// - 8 symbol PREAMBLE
/// - Explicit header with header CRC (handled internally by the radio)
/// - 4 octets HEADER: (TO, FROM, ID, FLAGS)
/// - 0 to 251 octets DATA
/// - CRC (handled internally by the radio)
///
/// \par Connecting RFM95/96/97/98 and Semtech SX1276/77/78/79 to Arduino
///
/// We tested with Anarduino MiniWirelessLoRA, which is an Arduino Duemilanove compatible with a RFM96W
/// module on-board. Therefore it needs no connections other than the USB
/// programming connection and an antenna to make it work.
///
/// If you have a bare RFM95/96/97/98 that you want to connect to an Arduino, you
/// might use these connections (untested): CAUTION: you must use a 3.3V type
/// Arduino, otherwise you will also need voltage level shifters between the
/// Arduino and the RFM95.  CAUTION, you must also ensure you connect an
/// antenna.
///
/// \code
///                 Arduino      RFM95/96/97/98
///                 GND----------GND   (ground in)
///                 3V3----------3.3V  (3.3V in)
/// interrupt 0 pin D2-----------DIO0  (interrupt request out)
///          SS pin D10----------NSS   (CS chip select in)
///         SCK pin D13----------SCK   (SPI clock in)
///        MOSI pin D11----------MOSI  (SPI Data in)
///        MISO pin D12----------MISO  (SPI Data out)
/// \endcode
/// With these connections, you can then use the default constructor RH_RF95().
/// You can override the default settings for the SS pin and the interrupt in
/// the RH_RF95 constructor if you wish to connect the slave select SS to other
/// than the normal one for your Arduino (D10 for Diecimila, Uno etc and D53
/// for Mega) or the interrupt request to other than pin D2 (Caution,
/// different processors have different constraints as to the pins available
/// for interrupts).
///
/// You can connect a Modtronix inAir4 or inAir9 directly to a 3.3V part such as a Teensy 3.1 like
/// this (tested).
/// \code
///                 Teensy      inAir4 inAir9
///                 GND----------0V   (ground in)
///                 3V3----------3.3V  (3.3V in)
/// interrupt 0 pin D2-----------D0   (interrupt request out)
///          SS pin D10----------CS    (CS chip select in)
///         SCK pin D13----------CK    (SPI clock in)
///        MOSI pin D11----------SI    (SPI Data in)
///        MISO pin D12----------SO    (SPI Data out)
/// \endcode
/// With these connections, you can then use the default constructor RH_RF95().
/// you must also set the transmitter power with useRFO:
/// driver.setTxPower(13, true);
///
/// Note that if you are using Modtronix inAir4 or inAir9,or any other module which uses the
/// transmitter RFO pins and not the PA_BOOST pins
/// that you must configure the power transmitter power for -1 to 14 dBm and with useRFO true.
/// Failure to do that will result in extremely low transmit powers.
///
/// If you have an Arduino M0 Pro from arduino.org,
/// you should note that you cannot use Pin 2 for the interrupt line
/// (Pin 2 is for the NMI only). The same comments apply to Pin 4 on Arduino Zero from arduino.cc.
/// Instead you can use any other pin (we use Pin 3) and initialise RH_RF69 like this:
/// \code
/// // Slave Select is pin 10, interrupt is Pin 3
/// RH_RF95 driver(10, 3);
/// \endcode
///
/// If you have a Rocket Scream Mini Ultra Pro with the RFM95W:
/// - Ensure you have Arduino SAMD board support 1.6.5 or later in Arduino IDE 1.6.8 or later.
/// - The radio SS is hardwired to pin D5 and the DIO0 interrupt to pin D2,
/// so you need to initialise the radio like this:
/// \code
/// RH_RF95 driver(5, 2);
/// \endcode
/// - The name of the serial port on that board is 'SerialUSB', not 'Serial', so this may be helpful at the top of our
///   sample sketches:
/// \code
/// #define Serial SerialUSB
/// \endcode
/// - You also need this in setup before radio initialisation
/// \code
/// // Ensure serial flash is not interfering with radio communication on SPI bus
///  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
///  digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
/// \endcode
/// - and if you have a 915MHz part, you need this after driver/manager intitalisation:
/// \code
/// rf95.setFrequency(915.0);
/// \endcode
/// which adds up to modifying sample sketches something like:
/// \code
/// #include <SPI.h>
/// #include <RH_RF95.h>
/// RH_RF95 rf95(5, 2); // Rocket Scream Mini Ultra Pro with the RFM95W
/// #define Serial SerialUSB
///
/// void setup()
/// {
///   // Ensure serial flash is not interfering with radio communication on SPI bus
///   pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
///   digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
///
///   Serial.begin(9600);
///   while (!Serial) ; // Wait for serial port to be available
///   if (!rf95.init())
///     Serial.println("init failed");
///   rf95.setFrequency(915.0);
/// }
/// ...
/// \endcode
///
/// For Adafruit Feather M0 with RFM95, construct the driver like this:
/// \code
/// RH_RF95 rf95(8, 3);
/// \endcode
///
/// If you have a talk2 Whisper Node LoRa board with on-board RF95 radio,
/// the example rf95_* sketches work without modification. Initialise the radio like
/// with the default constructor:
/// \code
///  RH_RF95 driver;
/// \endcode
///
/// It is possible to have 2 or more radios connected to one Arduino, provided
/// each radio has its own SS and interrupt line (SCK, SDI and SDO are common
/// to all radios)
///
/// Caution: on some Arduinos such as the Mega 2560, if you set the slave
/// select pin to be other than the usual SS pin (D53 on Mega 2560), you may
/// need to set the usual SS pin to be an output to force the Arduino into SPI
/// master mode.
///
/// Caution: Power supply requirements of the RFM module may be relevant in some circumstances:
/// RFM95/96/97/98 modules are capable of pulling 120mA+ at full power, where Arduino's 3.3V line can
/// give 50mA. You may need to make provision for alternate power supply for
/// the RFM module, especially if you wish to use full transmit power, and/or you have
/// other shields demanding power. Inadequate power for the RFM is likely to cause symptoms such as:
/// - reset's/bootups terminate with "init failed" messages
/// - random termination of communication after 5-30 packets sent/received
/// - "fake ok" state, where initialization passes fluently, but communication doesn't happen
/// - shields hang Arduino boards, especially during the flashing
///
/// \par Interrupts
///
/// The RH_RF95 driver uses interrupts to react to events in the RFM module,
/// such as the reception of a new packet, or the completion of transmission
/// of a packet.  The RH_RF95 driver interrupt service routine reads status from
/// and writes data to the the RFM module via the SPI interface. It is very
/// important therefore, that if you are using the RH_RF95 driver with another
/// SPI based deviced, that you disable interrupts while you transfer data to
/// and from that other device.  Use cli() to disable interrupts and sei() to
/// reenable them.
///
/// \par Memory
///
/// The RH_RF95 driver requires non-trivial amounts of memory. The sample
/// programs all compile to about 8kbytes each, which will fit in the
/// flash proram memory of most Arduinos. However, the RAM requirements are
/// more critical. Therefore, you should be vary sparing with RAM use in
/// programs that use the RH_RF95 driver.
///
/// It is often hard to accurately identify when you are hitting RAM limits on Arduino.
/// The symptoms can include:
/// - Mysterious crashes and restarts
/// - Changes in behaviour when seemingly unrelated changes are made (such as adding print() statements)
/// - Hanging
/// - Output from Serial.print() not appearing
///
/// \par Range
///
/// We have made some simple range tests under the following conditions:
/// - rf95_client base station connected to a VHF discone antenna at 8m height above ground
/// - rf95_server mobile connected to 17.3cm 1/4 wavelength antenna at 1m height, no ground plane.
/// - Both configured for 13dBm, 434MHz, Bw = 125 kHz, Cr = 4/8, Sf = 4096chips/symbol, CRC on. Slow+long range
/// - Minimum reported RSSI seen for successful comms was about -91
/// - Range over flat ground through heavy trees and vegetation approx 2km.
/// - At 20dBm (100mW) otherwise identical conditions approx 3km.
/// - At 20dBm, along salt water flat sandy beach, 3.2km.
///
/// It should be noted that at this data rate, a 12 octet message takes 2 seconds to transmit.
///
/// At 20dBm (100mW) with Bw = 125 kHz, Cr = 4/5, Sf = 128chips/symbol, CRC on.
/// (Default medium range) in the conditions described above.
/// - Range over flat ground through heavy trees and vegetation approx 2km.
///
/// Caution: the performance of this radio, especially with narrow bandwidths is strongly dependent on the
/// accuracy and stability of the chip clock. HopeRF and Semtech do not appear to
/// recommend bandwidths of less than 62.5 kHz
/// unless you have the optional Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator (TCXO) installed and
/// enabled on your radio module. See the refernece manual for more data.
/// Also https://lowpowerlab.com/forum/rf-range-antennas-rfm69-library/lora-library-experiences-range/15/
/// and http://www.semtech.com/images/datasheet/an120014-xo-guidance-lora-modulation.pdf
///
/// \par Transmitter Power
///
/// You can control the transmitter power on the RF transceiver
/// with the RH_RF95::setTxPower() function. The argument can be any of
/// +5 to +23 (for modules that use PA_BOOST)
/// -1 to +14 (for modules that use RFO transmitter pin)
/// The default is 13. Eg:
/// \code
/// driver.setTxPower(10); // use PA_BOOST transmitter pin
/// driver.setTxPower(10, true); // use PA_RFO pin transmitter pin
/// \endcode
