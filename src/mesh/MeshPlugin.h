 * A plugin allows you to add new features to meshtastic device code, without needing to know messaging details.
 *
 * A key concept for this is that your plugin should use a particular "portnum" for each message type you want to receive
 * and handle.
 *
 * Interally we use plugins to implement the core meshtastic text messaging and gps position sharing features.  You
 * can use these classes as examples for how to write your own custom plugin.  See here: (FIXME)
