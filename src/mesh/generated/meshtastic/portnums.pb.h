/* Enum definitions */
/* For any new 'apps' that run on the device or via sister apps on phones/PCs they should pick and use a
 unique 'portnum' for their application.
 If you are making a new app using meshtastic, please send in a pull request to add your 'portnum' to this
 master table.
 PortNums should be assigned in the following range:
 0-63   Core Meshtastic use, do not use for third party apps
 64-127 Registered 3rd party apps, send in a pull request that adds a new entry to portnums.proto to  register your application
 256-511 Use one of these portnums for your private applications that you don't want to register publically
 All other values are reserved.
 Note: This was formerly a Type enum named 'typ' with the same id #
 We have change to this 'portnum' based scheme for specifying app handlers for particular payloads.
 This change is backwards compatible by treating the legacy OPAQUE/CLEAR_TEXT values identically. */
