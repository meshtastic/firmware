/* Enum definitions */
/* For any new 'apps' that run on the device or via sister apps on phones/PCs they should pick and use a
 unique 'portnum' for their application.
 If you are making a new app using meshtastic, please send in a pull request to add your 'portnum' to this
 master table.
 PortNums should be assigned in the following range:
 0-63   Core Meshtastic use, do not use for third party apps
 64-127 Registered 3rd party apps, send in a pull request that adds a new entry to portnums.proto to  register your application
 256-511 Use one of these portnums for your private applications that you don't want to register publically
 All other values are reserved.

 We have change to this 'portnum' based scheme for specifying app handlers for particular payloads.
 This change is backwards compatible by treating the legacy OPAQUE/CLEAR_TEXT values identically. */
