/* How this channel is being used (or not).
 Note: this field is an enum to give us options for the future.
 In particular, someday we might make a 'SCANNING' option.
 SCANNING channels could have different frequencies and the radio would
 occasionally check that freq to see if anything is being transmitted.
 For devices that have multiple physical radios attached, we could keep multiple PRIMARY/SCANNING channels active at once to allow
 cross band routing as needed.
 If a device has only a single radio (the common case) only one channel can be PRIMARY at a time
 (but any number of SECONDARY channels can't be sent received on that common frequency) */

/* This information can be encoded as a QRcode/url so that other users can configure
 their radio to join the same channel.
 A note about how channel names are shown to users: channelname-X
 poundsymbol is a prefix used to indicate this is a channel name (idea from @professr).
 Where X is a letter from A-Z (base 26) representing a hash of the PSK for this
 channel - so that if the user changes anything about the channel (which does
 force a new PSK) this letter will also change. Thus preventing user confusion if
 two friends try to type in a channel name of "BobsChan" and then can't talk
 because their PSKs will be different.
 The PSK is hashed into this letter by "0x41 + [xor all bytes of the psk ] modulo 26"
 This also allows the option of someday if people have the PSK off (zero), the
 users COULD type in a channel name and be able to talk.

 the chance of this 64 bit random number colliding with anyone else is super low.
 And the penalty for collision is low as well, it just means that anyone trying to decrypt channel messages might need to
 try multiple candidate channels.
 Any time a non wire compatible change is made to a channel, this field should be regenerated.
