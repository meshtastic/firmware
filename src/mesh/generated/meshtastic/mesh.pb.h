 (values must be <= 127 to keep protobuf field to one byte in size.
 Detailed background on this field:
 I noticed a funny side effect of lora being so slow: Usually when making
 a protocol there isn’t much need to use message priority to change the order
 of transmission (because interfaces are fairly fast).
 But for lora where packets can take a few seconds each, it is very important
 to make sure that critical packets are sent ASAP.
 In the case of meshtastic that means we want to send protocol acks as soon as possible
 (to prevent unneeded retransmissions), we want routing messages to be sent next,
 then messages marked as reliable and finally ‘background’ packets like periodic position updates.
 So I bit the bullet and implemented a new (internal - not sent over the air)
 field in MeshPacket called ‘priority’.
 And the transmission queue in the router object is now a priority queue. */

 when a node starts up, it broadcasts their user and the normal flow is for all
 other nodes to reply with their User as well (so the new node can build its nodedb)
 If a node ever receives a User (not just the first broadcast) message where
 the sender node number equals our node number, that indicates a collision has
 occurred and the following steps should happen:
 If the receiving node (that was already in the mesh)'s macaddr is LOWER than the
 new User who just tried to sign in: it gets to keep its nodenum.
 We send a broadcast message of OUR User (we use a broadcast so that the other node can
 receive our message, considering we have the same id - it also serves to let
 observers correct their nodedb) - this case is rare so it should be okay.
 If any node receives a User where the macaddr is GTE than their local macaddr,
 they have been vetoed and should pick a new random nodenum (filtering against
 whatever it knows about the nodedb) and rebroadcast their User.
