 Also provides easy remote access to any GPIO.
 In the future other remote hardware operations can be added based on user interest
 (i.e. serial output, spi/i2c input/output).
 FIXME - currently this feature is turned on by default which is dangerous

 It should be off by default and then protected based on some TBD mechanism
 (a special channel once multichannel support is included?) */
