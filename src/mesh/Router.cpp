/**
 * Router todo
 *
 * DONE: Implement basic interface and use it elsewhere in app
 * Add naive flooding mixin (& drop duplicate rx broadcasts), add tools for sending broadcasts with incrementing sequence #s
 * Add an optional adjacent node only 'send with ack' mixin.  If we timeout waiting for the ack, call handleAckTimeout(packet)
 * Add DSR mixin
