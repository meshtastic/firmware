      \brief Default constructor. Called from Arduino sketch when creating new LoRa instance.

    // basic methods

    /*!
      \brief %LoRa modem initialization method. Must be called at least once from Arduino sketch to initialize the module.

      \param freq Carrier frequency in MHz. Allowed values range from 868.0 MHz to 915.0 MHz.

      \param bw %LoRa link bandwidth in kHz. Allowed values are 10.4, 15.6, 20.8, 31.25, 41.7, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 kHz.

      \param sf %LoRa link spreading factor. Allowed values range from 6 to 12.

      \param cr %LoRa link coding rate denominator. Allowed values range from 5 to 8.

      \param syncWord %LoRa sync word. Can be used to distinguish different networks. Note that value 0x34 is reserved for LoRaWAN networks.

      \param power Transmission output power in dBm. Allowed values range from 2 to 17 dBm.

      \param currentLimit Trim value for OCP (over current protection) in mA. Can be set to multiplies of 5 in range 45 to 120 mA and to multiples of 10 in range 120 to 240 mA.
      Set to 0 to disable OCP (not recommended).

      \param preambleLength Length of %LoRa transmission preamble in symbols. The actual preamble length is 4.25 symbols longer than the set number.
      Allowed values range from 6 to 65535.

      \param gain Gain of receiver LNA (low-noise amplifier). Can be set to any integer in range 1 to 6 where 1 is the highest gain.
      Set to 0 to enable automatic gain control (recommended).

      \returns \ref status_codes
