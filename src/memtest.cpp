         * Address line test
         *
         * Description: Test the address bus wiring in a
         *              memory region by performing a walking
         *              1's test on the relevant bits of the
         *              address and checking for aliasing.
         *              This test will find single-bit
         *              address failures such as stuck -high,
         *              stuck-low, and shorted pins. The base
         *              address and size of the region are
         *              selected by the caller.
         *
         * Notes:	For best results, the selected base
         *              address should have enough LSB 0's to
         *              guarantee single address bit changes.
         *              For example, to test a 64-Kbyte
         *              region, select a base address on a
         *              64-Kbyte boundary. Also, select the
         *              region size as a power-of-two if at
         *              all possible.
         *
         * Returns:     0 if the test succeeds, 1 if the test fails.
         *
         * ## NOTE ##	Be sure to specify start and end
         *              addresses such that addr_mask has
         *              lots of bits set. For example an
         *              address range of 01000000 02000000 is
         *              bad while a range of 01000000
         *              01ffffff is perfect.
