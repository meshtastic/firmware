# Note: This module integrates an additional PA to achieve higher output power.
# The 'power' parameter here does not represent the actual RF output.
# TX_GAIN_LORA defines the gain offset applied at each SX1262 input power step (1–22 dBm).
# Each array element corresponds to the additional gain when that input level is set,
# The effective RF output is: Pout ≈ Pset + TX_GAIN_LORA[index].
