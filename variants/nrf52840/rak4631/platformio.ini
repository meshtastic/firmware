; If not set we will default to uploading over serial (first it forces bootloader entry by talking 1200bps to cdcacm)
; Note: as of 6/2013 the serial/bootloader based programming takes approximately 30 seconds
;upload_protocol = jlink

; Allows programming and debug via the RAK NanoDAP as the default debugger tool for the RAK4631 (it is only $10!)
; programming time is about the same as the bootloader version.
; For information on this see the meshtastic developers documentation for "Development on the NRF52"

; NOTE: the pyocd support for semihosting is buggy.  So I switched to using the builtin platformio support for the stlink adapter which worked much better.
; However the built in openocd version in platformio has buggy support for TCP to semihosting. 
;
; So I'm now trying the external openocd - but the openocd scripts for nrf52.cfg assume you are using a DAP adapter not an STLINK adapter.
; In theory I could change those scripts.  But for now I'm trying going back to a DAP adapter but with the external openocd.
