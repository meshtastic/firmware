; However the built in openocd version in platformio has buggy support for TCP to semihosting.

; So I'm now trying the external openocd - but the openocd scripts for nrf52.cfg assume you are using a DAP adapter not an STLINK adapter.
; In theory I could change those scripts.  But for now I'm trying going back to a DAP adapter but with the external openocd.
